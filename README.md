# Twitter-Clone Project

## Overview
The Twitter-Clone project is a demonstration of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills, showcasing the implementation of various data structures in a simplified social media context. In this project, user IDs are created and managed using a linked list, tweets are displayed using a queue, and stacks are employed for handling notifications. Additionally, file handling is utilized for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features

### 1. User ID Management
   - User IDs are dynamically created and organized using a linked list.
   - The linked list allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of user IDs.

### 2. Tweet Display with Queue
   - Tweets are managed and displayed using a queue data structure.
   - The queue ensures that tweets are presented in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order, simulating real-time updates.

### 3. Notification Handling with Stacks
   - Notifications, such as new followers or likes, are managed using a stack.
   - The stack enables efficient handling of notifications, ensuring that the most recent notifications are displayed first.

### 4. File Handling
   - File handling is implemented for persistent storage of user data and tweets.
   - This feature enhances the project's scalability and allows users to retrieve their data even after restarting the application.
